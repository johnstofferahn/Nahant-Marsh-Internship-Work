# Nahant Marsh 2025 Song Monitor Project

### by John Stofferahn

This repository preserves the coding files, project planning, and final poster presentation created and used in the 2025 Song Monitor Project at Nahant Marsh in 2025, and explains the thought processes by which the terms of this project dictated the creation of these files.

## Abstract

In the summer of 2025 when I was a Research Intern at the Nahant Marsh Education Center in Davenport, Iowa, the research project I chose to concentrate on was the Marsh's study on the bird populations present within Marsh boundaries. Although this was long an area of interest for the Marsh, this was the first time anyone had analyzed the populations in this specific manner, meaning that I was responsible not only for creating the terms of the project and analyzing the results but also designing and writing the code by which the project data could be conglomerated and plotted.

## Skills

In order to complete this project in a timely and effective manner, I not only utilized my existing skills in project management, interpersonal communication and planning, and technical skills, but also developed these further.

Alongside being an effective teammember for the Nahant Marsh staff workers, I markedly improved my skills in file management alongside R, Excel, and other programs necessary for the project. Thus, through this project I was able to grow my technical and interpersonal skills, which should prove especially useful as I continue to work in this line of business in the future.
